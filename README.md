GOALS:
1. to have one app to deploy anywhere (URL, iOS, Android)
2. to use one simple file to handle config (i.e. variables & URL's)
3. to keep the logic separated from the front end (to make decoupling to a new UI simpler)
4. to provide a simple CLI to build & deploy (for all cases, including targeted: e.g. deploy_url, deploy_ios, deploy_android, deploy_all)
5. to provide a library of common frontend templates (login, post list, post edit, user list, user edit, cpt list, cpt edit)
6. to show some examples of a custom API endpoint & how to bring that into the frontend (e.g. https://anchor.host/getting-started-with-axios-and-wordpress)
